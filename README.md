# Polygon Area on a Grid — Pick's Theorem

This repository contains a mathematical problem-solving exercise focused on calculating the area of polygons with lattice-point vertices using **Pick’s Theorem**:

> **Area = p + (q / 2) – 1**  
> where:
> - `p` = number of interior lattice points  
> - `q` = number of boundary lattice points
